OpenWaterLab(OWL)'s mission is to provide high-quality, transparent, and reusable tools for researchers, engineers, utilities and practitioners working on the modelling and digital representation of water systems.

It aims to:

- Support **open, transparent and reproducible** models and tools for water system research and practice.
- Build a **modular and extensible toolbox** for modelling, simulation, analysis and digital twin developments of water systems.
- Encourage **collaboration and knowledge sharing** between researchers, developers, engineers and utilities in the community.
- Lower the barrier to adopting **open digital water technologies** in both research and applied contexts.
